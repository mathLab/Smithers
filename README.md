**SMITHERS**: Smithers' a Mathematical Interdisciplinary Toolbox for Helping Engineers Researchers and Scientist

## Description
**Smithers** is a generic library for scientific computing developed in Python
that aims to facilitate the development of many typical routines. It is
substantially a multi-purpose toolbox that inherits functionality from other
packages to make easier and compact the coding of recurrent workflows.



## Dependencies and installation
**Smithers** requires `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`, which are the common libraries for scientific computing in the Python community.
All the other dependencies of **Smithers** are imported *at runtime*.
